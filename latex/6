This is very important in software development and will become very important in OpenMaths. \nVersion control systems (like Git) usually operate on the line level, meaning history and authorship of a file is done on the line level.  \nFor example if another user where to edit this line, perhaps correcting a spelleeng mistake, then they would get ownership of the entire line.\nSo when users put lots of code / LaTeX on one line it can become difficult to track which parts of the code correspond to various authors. \nSimilarly for dates of modifications.\n\\item Following on from the point on version control, this can also have an impact on performance.  Given the cheapness of modern computers this is unlikely to be of much importance but we mention it anyway for completeness.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nNote that for LaTeX this restriction does not effect display. For example {\\bf this content} has it's paragraphs broken out into several lines yet it still displays as a single paragraph.\nWhen to insert line breaks can sometimes seem arbitrary, especially for continuous pros.  \nAs a rough rule of thumb we recommend splitting lines at punctuation points.\nTherefore we would greatly appreciate all content following this convention.
