First we need to formally define what is here meant by style:\n\n\\section{Definition - Style}\n\nFor a string of symbols in a language, the \"style\" of that string is the form of the symbols that does not contribute to the abstract syntax tree.\\par\n\nWe can then define \"good style\" with respect to a conscious being wishing to learn the meaning of a string as how easy it is for that string to be understood over other syntactically equivalent strings.\nSo at this stage we do not have an objective definition of \"good style\". \nFurthermore \"conscious being\" and \"learn\" here are being taken as primitive terms,\n unfortunately currently the human race has not produced a formal definition of what consciousness is.\nWe leave such a discussion to Rodger Penrose in the fantastic book \"Shadows of the Mind\".\\par\n\nIn the meantime though we can assume such definitions in principle exist.\nWe can also argue that {\\it how easy} learning information from a string is is related to the information theoretic complexity of that string.\nFor example \n\n$$1 + 1 = 2$$ \n\nis easier to understand than \n\n$$(((1))+($$\n$$1))) = ((( \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, 2)$$\n$$))$$\n\neven though the abstract syntax tree of these two statements are identical.\\par\n\nIf we presented the second form to even those that are the most skeptical of objectivism, they would object to it's use in practice.\nTherefore it seems safe to assume there exists a pair of strings $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ is sufficiently more complex than $B$\nso that all conscious beings would agree that $B$ is preferably to $A$.\\par\n\nTherefore there can exist decisions about style that are objectively \"good style\".\\par\n\nIt remains to argue for assumption 2.  \nThis one is unlikely to be contentious.\nWe will just say that this kind of assumption is necessary to allow us to do any directed action at all. \nWe must have faith that making decisions will result in better outcomes than rolling a dice.\nIf you disagree, then please remember to roll a dice to decide whether you should complain.\\par\n\nTo be clear, we are not saying that every style decision will have an objective right or wrong answer, \njust that some decisions will according to some yet undiscovered yet well defined process.\n\n\\section{Culture, Context and Democracy}\n\nOf course different cultures and social groups will develop isolated conventions such that styles incorporating those conventions will be easier to understand for those in that group.\nIn information theoretic terms it can be argued that such conventions occupy a \"shared memory space\", \nand therefore a group collectively reduces the complexity of their communications.\nTherefore a reasonable heuristic system should aim to include rules regarding these conventions in addition to objectively good style.\\par\n\nThis is democratic, but not arbitrary or anti-socratic.\nThe objective is communication i.e. the transfer of information in a group of conscious beings.  \nWe are sure given that elusive definition of consciousness, \nit would follow through an information theoretic argument that democratic processes are the best way to decide how to communicate when objective processes are lacking.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nIn conclusion we should aim to derive and follow a system of style that is heuristically objective when possible, \nand democratic and mutable for every other situation. \nOpenMaths will achieve this by providing a style guide (TODO link) that includes mutable rules for writing content but also on how to partake in the democratic process.  \nPlease read the guide carefully including the section that describes how the system should {\\bf not} be used.
