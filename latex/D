Therefore intelligently use whitespace to make pattern recognition easier.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Rules}\n\nWe would argue that the following rules best applies the above principles\\par\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Predicates and functions, and predicate like macros and function like macros, should be written: \"F(x)\" for single variables and \"F(x, y, z)\" for many variables.\n          That is spaces after commas, no space between the symbol and the first paren, no space after the first paren and no space before the last paren.\n    \\item Always put spaces around symbols used in infix notation, e.g. \"x = y + 1\" rather than \"x=y+1\".\n    \\item Put spaces after large unary operator type symbols, e.g. \"\\\\sum_\\{i = 1\\} x\" rather than \"\\\\sum_\\{i = 1\\}x\".\n    \\item Give escaped curly braces whitespace breathing room, e.g. \"\\\\\\{ x \\\\\\}\" rather than \"\\\\\\{x\\\\\\}\".\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Democratic System}\n\nTODO
