These line numbers must be in the same order as the forms $P_1 , ... , P_N$ in the conjunction. \n+The most famous rule of proof is of course {\\id=q Modus Ponens}, observe how we formulate it and label it as though it's just another Axiom Schema.  \n+In essence this is the only rule of proof we provide \"natively\", but due to the generalization of a rule of proof as a conjunction-implication statement this opens the door to arbitrary rules (see below).\\par\n+\n+When you submit a proof OpenMaths will automatically create the corresponding Theorem where it will use the last line of the proof as the statement of the Theorem.\n+\n+\\section{Axiom Schemas}\n+\n+There is a distinction between Logical Axiom Schemas and Axiom Schemas, the former defines the very notion of a proof while the latter essentially defines an Axiomatization of some other concept (like sets). \n+The most famous example of an Axiom Schema is {\\id=j The Axiom Schema of Specification}, while an example of a Logical Axiom Scheme is the {\\id=n 1st propositional axiom of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz} axiomatization of propositional logic. \\par\n+\n+The crucial difference between these two types of Schemas is that Axiom Schemas and their use is limited to sentences, while Logical Axiom Schemas are allowed free variables.\n+\n+\\section{Meta Proofs and Meta Theorems}\n+\n+Historically formal proof systems have been somewhat human unusable due to the limited rules of proof and limited logical axiom schemas.  \n+So we provide a meta-mathematical proof framework so that Meta Theorems can be introduced.  These Meta Theorems can then be used in regular proofs just like Logical Axiom Schemas. \n+Then as noted above anything of the conjunction-implication form can also be used as a {\\bf rule of proof}.\\par\n+\n+Writing a Meta Proof is exactly the same as writing a regular proof except since a meta-proof will need to deal with arbitrary statements you must declare what statements symbols will be as the first line. \n+For example suppose we wish to show Hypothetical Syllogism or Transitivity of Implication, that is $((p \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (q \\rightarrow r)) \\rightarrow (p \\rightarrow r)$ we first need to declare $p, q$ and $r$.  \n+We would do this in the same way we declare statements in Definitions, Notation, Axiom Schemas or Logical Axiom Schemas:\\par\n+\n+$\\forall p \\forall q \\forall r \\text{Wff}(p) \\wedge \\text{Wff}(q) \\wedge \\text{Wff}(r)$. declartion\\par\n+\n+Then we can use these in the meta-proof. A nice simple example of a Meta Proof is {\\id=s Reflexivity of Implication}.
