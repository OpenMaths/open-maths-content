Then you use the $\\rightarrow$ symbol, \nthen you declare the notation using the $:=$ predicate (you can use $:=$ in infix notation style if you have {\\id=0 Alias Alias} as a dependency))\n\\par\nA good simple example is {\\id=8 Set Intersection}, that is the $\\cap$ symbol.

This is because we have not yet fully implemented a type system that can resolve the ambiguity (but are very close).
