A good example of a Definition is {\\id=1 If and Only If}, an example of notation is the {\\id=4 Empty Set}.\n\nCurrently definitions require quotes since we reuse the $:=$ symbol, which is technically a {\\it meta predicate}, that is a predicate about statements.  \nThe quotes are required to make a distinction between the object language and the meta language. \\par\n\nIn future we may add a language feature that allows one to drop quotes and we automatically infer the quotes if we have sufficient demand. \nThough we quite like the clarity introduced by quotes even though it's unconventional in mathematics to use quotes when defining something.
